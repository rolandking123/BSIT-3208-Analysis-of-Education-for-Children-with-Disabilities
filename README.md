## Introduction
Although significant progress has been made in improving access to school over the last two decades, research suggests that many children with disabilities are still being left behind. Without guaranteeing that children with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups receive a quality education, the world will fall short of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4: achieving quality education for all.  

Children with disabilities are often associated with low expectations in the public mind. Parents must believe in the importance of educating disabled children. The higher the expectations, the more likely they will be accepted into the family. All disabled students must be enrolled in primary schools. The child will be put in appropriate educational settings after a team of a doctor, a psychologist, and a special educator assesses their difficulties in schools. Children with mild to moderate disabilities of any kind may be incorporated into regular schools, while those with severe disabilities may be placed in special schools or remedial schools. Dropouts who are unable to access the benefits of regular schools may enroll in open schools. All children with learning difficulties are managed in regular schools first. Children with disabilities can take vocational courses in open and special schools.

Children with disabilities are ten times less likely than their peers to attend school. Even if they go to school, they are more likely to drop out early because their education is often inferior to that of their peers. Furthermore, there is a lack of awareness about their learning needs in their communities and among teachers, which is often fueled by biases regarding disability.

If a child has a learning impairment or condition that makes learning more difficult for them than most children their age, they have special educational needs. They could be having difficulties with their schooling, communication, or behavior. Specialists, instructors, and non-profit organizations can assist and advise parents. In 2019â€“2020, 7.3 million kids, or 14 percent of all public school students, received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Specific learning difficulties were the most common type of disability among kids getting special education assistance (33 percent).

## Problem Statement
Children with disabilities and/or handicaps are not treated fairly and do not have a voice. Many individuals harass children with disabilities at school and do not treat them properly; it used to be far worse. Now, children with impairments have their own lunch time and classrooms, so others won't bother them or be bothered by them. Children with disabilities are typically the last in line for resources and services, which are already insufficient. They are frequently the recipients of pity or, worse, prejudice and abuse." It's sad that so many people are aware that children with disabilities are mistreated and do nothing about it. Disabled children, despite their differences, can learn; all they require is the implementation of appropriate teaching and evaluation procedures. The ability to integrate those adjustments might lead to improved outcomes for disabled students.

## Significance of the Proposed Project
This study aims to provide the analysis of education for the children who have special needs. It is undeniable that education is critical for all children, particularly those with disabilities and limited social and economic opportunities. The special education system improved access to public school for children with disabilities. Aside from that, the special education system has provided them with an appropriate framework for their education, as well as allowing the institutions involved to identify children with disability sooner. As a result, children with disabilities are more likely to be included alongside their non-disabled peers.

This study intends to explore on the services provided to students with disabilities, as well as the impact of these services have on their educational and professional ambitions. It will look into whether the challenges faced by special needs children are related to how effective policies are in meeting their needs. This study is important to children with disabilities because it can help them learn about the educational opportunities accessible to them, as well as the institutions they can turn to for financial assistance and the treatment they should expect from society.

## Methods
In this study we use a qualitative approach to explain things in order to uncover patterns and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed. Recent study looks into new international trends in the education of children with disabilities, as well as their historical background. This descriptive study consists of the necessity of changing methods from special education to inclusive education. Our main purpose is to develop new trends rather than simply presenting the current trend toward inclusive education. Semi-structured  interview was  chosen  as  the methodological approach since they provide reliable and comparable qualitative data and also allow informants the freedom  to express  their views  in their  own  terms. With  the  help  of a semi-structured  questionnaire,  the experiences  and  perceptions  of  head-teachers,  teachers and  teacher  conductors  in  special/segregated  and inclusive schools were collected. 

## Expected Output
Every child has the right to the same opportunities as others, regardless of the difficulties they face. Special education is of great importance for children with learning disabilities, because it gives them the opportunity to get quality education in line with their unique needs. Special education enables every student to gain a high level of independence and reach their full potential. The extent to which children with disabilities are deprived, feel discriminated against, and lack hope for the future demonstrates that societies are not doing enough to ensure that all children's most basic human rights are realized. 

The objectives of this study is to identify a good education for children with disabilities, to understand the concept of schooling needed by children with disabilities, as well as determining the importance of resolving children with disabilities problems. This provides a data visualization for the issues related to the children with disabilities, and it includes that children with disabilities have the right to receive education in an inclusive setting and with the supports needed to succeed. As a result, the vicious cycle of exclusion and disadvantage that leaves children with disabilities behind continues. It must be a top priority to include children with disabilities in all parts of life. Every child, no matter where they are, has something to contribute. His or her talents, ideas, and energies have the potential to positively impact families, communities, and the world. The study aims to promote the global inclusion of children and young people with disabilities by ensuring that they are counted, consulted, and taken into account when making decisions.
